Tile Detection based on Mask R-CNN in Non-Structural Environment for Robotic Tiling.</br></br>
Robotic tiling is an efficient way to replace manual work, with tile detection and positioning serving as a pivotal technology. However, the tiling environment is characterized by its complexity. Our study introduces the instance segmentation method Mask R-CNN, which can detect tiles in non-structural environments after proper training. To address the difficulty of acquiring datasets and high annotation costs, a densely arranged tile dataset that allows for automatic labeling has been synthesized and various designed data augmentation techniques are employed. </br></br>
This repository encompasses all the tile datasets used, the core programs, as well as the trained models.</br>
